=head1 NAME

Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK - provides a clean-room reimplementation of common::sense

=head1 VERSION

This is Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK 0.001, but it aims at compatibility
with common::sense 3.73.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use common::sense;
   
   # your code goes here

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Importing L<common::sense> is roughly equivalent to:

   use utf8;
   use strict qw(vars subs);
   use feature qw(say state switch);
   use feature qw(unicode_strings current_sub fc evalbytes);
   no feature qw(array_base);
   no warnings;
   use warnings qw(FATAL closed threads internal debugging pack
                   portable prototype inplace io pipe unpack malloc
                   deprecated glob digit printf layer
                   reserved taint closure semicolon);
   no warnings qw(exec newline unopened);

Unfortunately the installation process (and to a lesser extent, the
implementation) for L<common::sense> is fairly crazy.

Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK is an L<Alt> implementation of
L<common::sense>. To use it, continue to C<< use common::sense >>
in your code, but to install it, do:

   cpanm Alt::common::sense::TOBYINK
